## 2. The project we are working on

The mental healthcare service system **mindfulNESS** involves professional resources to promote mental healthcare and
treat
mental illnesses. It includes many services such as disease search, disease testing, and appointment booking with a
consultant.

The project provided a valuable opportunity to apply **database management principles** to a real-world problem in the
field of mental health. It showcased the practical application of database management principles in addressing
challenges in
mental health.

To be short, the project aims to:

- []() Create a game that is redesigned to entertain and educate players.

- []() Practicing OOP techniques in the Theory class.

- []() Go through the process of game management and code refining.

- []() Evaluate the ability to build more features on top of the basic code.

<!-- REASON -->

# REASON ðŸ©º

## 1. Motivation

The global pandemic has profoundly impacted mental health, resulting in increased recognition of the importance of
psychological therapy. However, accessing traditional therapy can still be challenging for many people due to factors
such as long wait-lists, high costs, and the enduring stigma associated with mental health

## 2. Idea

To address these barriers and meet the growing demand for mental health services, online therapy platforms have
emerged as a popular and accessible option. These platforms offer a wide range of mental health services. One of the
critical advantages of online therapy is its flexibility, allowing individuals to schedule sessions at their
convenience and receive therapy from the comfort of their homes. They also offer more affordable pricing than
traditional in-person therapy, making therapy accessible to a broader audience.

Among the well-known online therapy platforms are BetterHelp, Talkspace, and Amwell. BetterHelp provides various
therapy options, including live sessions, messaging, and chat support. Talkspace specializes in unlimited messaging
therapy with licensed therapists. On the other hand, Amwell offers mental health services as part of its broader
telehealth platform, including access to medical doctors and specialists.

## 3. Roadmap

- [x] There are 2 distinct roles: patient and consultant for users to choose from
- [x] The system allows patients to search for diseases and take health tests with real scores and solutions
- [x] Patients can make an appointment with a specialist if their illness is severe
- [ ] More to come...

Please see the [open issues](https://github.com/itzmealvin/PDM_mindfulNESS_PC) for a full list of proposed features (
and known issues).
